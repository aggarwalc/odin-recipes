    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      7-layer dip is a festive and flavorful appetizer that features a
      tantalizing combination of seven distinct layers, each adding its own
      texture and taste. Typically, this crowd-pleaser starts with a base of
      creamy refried beans, followed by a layer of rich sour cream mixed with
      zesty taco seasoning. Next comes a smooth layer of guacamole, topped with
      a generous spread of shredded cheddar cheese. A layer of crisp, diced
      tomatoes adds freshness, while chopped black olives and sliced green
      onions provide a touch of briny and aromatic contrast. Served with crunchy
      tortilla chips for dipping, this vibrant, multi-layered dip offers a
      satisfying blend of flavors and textures that are perfect for any
      gathering.
