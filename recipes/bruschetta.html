    <p>
      Bruschetta is a delightful Italian appetizer consisting of grilled or
      toasted slices of bread, typically rubbed with garlic and drizzled with
      extra virgin olive oil. The bread is often topped with a fresh mixture of
      diced tomatoes, basil, and a splash of balsamic vinegar, seasoned with
      salt and pepper. This simple yet flavorful dish offers a harmonious blend
      of crunchy texture and vibrant, aromatic toppings, making it a perfect
      starter or light snack.Â
