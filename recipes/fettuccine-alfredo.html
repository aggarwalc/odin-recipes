    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Fettuccine Alfredo is a classic Italian pasta dish known for its rich,
      creamy sauce. The star of this dish is fettuccine, a type of flat,
      ribbon-like pasta that’s cooked until tender. The sauce is a luscious
      blend of butter, heavy cream, and Parmesan cheese, which melts together to
      create a smooth and velvety coating for the pasta. A touch of garlic and a
      sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper add depth and a hint of spice.
      Often garnished with a bit of chopped parsley, Fettuccine Alfredo is a
      decadent and comforting dish, perfect for those moments when you’re
      craving something indulgent yet simple.
